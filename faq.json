    "question": "Why are Banks bad now?",
    "answer": "They are distributed to the Warband every 2 days, whereas in S1 it was 3 days. The 1 day difference of \"filling the tank\" means less money to steal. =)"

    "question": "What is P2W?",
    "answer": "“Pay to Win” is often criticized as using money to gain power in a game. Yet if time itself is a form of currency (time is money, friend!), then players who grind 16 hours a day are also paying — just with time instead of dollars. The difference is merely how we choose to \"Pay to Win\": Some invest their time into earning money with a job, others invest theirs directly into the game."
