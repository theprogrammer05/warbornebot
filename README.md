## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.8+
- Discord Bot Token
- GitHub Personal Access Token (for data persistence)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_bot_client_id
GUILD_ID=your_server_guild_id
ANNOUNCE_CHANNEL_ID=channel_for_daily_posts

npm start
```

## Deployment

This bot is configured for Railway deployment:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to your repository
3. Set environment variables in Railway
4. Deploy automatically

**Note:** `railway.toml` is configured to ignore JSON data files to prevent unnecessary redeployments.

## Data Persistence

All data is stored in JSON files and synced to GitHub:

- `reminders.json` - Active reminders
- `faq.json` - FAQ entries
- `schedule.json` - Daily event schedule
- `research.json` - Research information

Data survives bot restarts by syncing to GitHub and loading on startup.

## Architecture

- **index.js** - Main bot entry point, command handler, and schedule posting
- **commands/** - Slash command implementations
- **utils/** - Helper utilities (GitHub sync, reminder manager)
